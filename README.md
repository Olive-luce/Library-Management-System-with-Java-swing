This Java program is a **Library Management System with a graphical user interface (GUI)** built using **Swing**. The application is structured into multiple classes to separate responsibilities: the `Book` class stores information about each book (ISBN, title, author, genre, total and borrowed copies); the `Catalog` class manages the collection of books, providing methods for loading data, searching, borrowing, returning, and listing top borrowed books; and the `AbstractDataLoader` with its implementations (`FileDataLoader` and `DatabaseDataLoader`) handles loading book data from external sources such as a text file or a database. The main GUI class, `LMSGUI`, creates the window interface with a menu bar, book table, search panel, and status area. Users can load book data from a file or database, display all books, search by title/author/genre/ISBN, borrow and return books while updating availability, and view the most borrowed books. The system keeps the table synchronized with the backend catalog, and provides user-friendly error handling and status updates. This configuration makes the application modular, extensible, and easy to use for managing a small library collection.
